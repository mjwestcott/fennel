def start(app, exit=EXIT_SIGNAL):
    """
    The main entrypoint for the worker.

    The worker will create and monitor `N` :class:`fennel.worker.Executor` processes. Each
    `Executor` will spawn `M` coroutines via an asyncio event loop. `N` and `M` are
    controlled by :attr:`fennel.settings.Settings.processes` and
    :attr:`fennel.settings.Settings.concurrency` respectively.

    CPU-bound tasks benefit from multiple processes. IO-bound tasks will benefit from
    high executor concurrency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    app : fennel.App
        The application instance for which to start a background worker.
    exit : str
        The exit strategy. `EXIT_SIGNAL` is used when the worker should only stop on
        receipt of a interrupt or termination signal. `EXIT_COMPLETE` is used in tests
        to exit when all tasks from the queue have completed.

    Notes
    -----
    `signal.SIGINT` and `signal.SIGTERM` are handled by gracefully shutting down, which
    means giving the executor processes a chance to finish their current tasks.
